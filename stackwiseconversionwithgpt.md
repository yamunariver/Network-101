ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî this is one of the most important and often misunderstood parts of the Cisco Catalyst 9500 StackWise Virtual setup.
Let‚Äôs break down both concepts clearly and deeply:
‚öôÔ∏è StackWise Virtual ‚Äî Link & Dual-Active Detection (DAD) Explained
When you form a StackWise Virtual (SVL) between two Catalyst 9500 switches, the goal is to make them act as one logical switch.
However, for that to work safely and reliably, two main mechanisms are required:
üîπ 1. StackWise Virtual Link (SVL)
‚û§ Purpose
The StackWise Virtual Link is the lifeline between the two physical switches.
It:
Connects the active and standby control planes
Synchronizes data-plane, control-plane, and state information
Carries all inter-chassis traffic (data, control, keepalives, etc.)
‚û§ Functionality
Both switches share the same control plane information via SVL.
The Active switch controls management and configuration.
The Standby switch synchronizes configuration and forwarding tables in real-time.
‚û§ Key Notes
Property	Description
Link Type	Port-channel between the two chassis
Typical Speed	40G or 100G links (high bandwidth)
Function	Control, data, and state synchronization
Minimum	1 link required (2 recommended for redundancy)
Best Practice	Use at least two links on different line cards or modules
‚û§ Example SVL Configuration
stackwise-virtual
  domain 10
!
interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/49
  stackwise-virtual link 1
!
interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/49
  stackwise-virtual link 1
üí° Think of the SVL as the ‚Äúbackplane cable‚Äù between two chassis ‚Äî it‚Äôs what makes them act like one big switch.
üîπ 2. Dual-Active Detection (DAD)
‚û§ Purpose
DAD (Dual Active Detection) prevents a split-brain situation.
A split-brain occurs when:

The SVL (main link) goes down,
Both switches lose contact with each other, and
Each one believes it is Active.
This can cause:
Duplicate IPs and MACs in the network
ARP instability
Network loops
Hence, DAD acts as a backup heartbeat ‚Äî an independent link that ensures only one switch remains active.
‚û§ How DAD Works
Both switches monitor the SVL link status.
If the SVL fails, they immediately check the DAD link.
If the DAD link is alive, they exchange ‚ÄúI‚Äôm active‚Äù messages.
If both think they‚Äôre active:
One switch (standby) automatically goes into Recovery Mode (Dual-Active Recovery).
The Active switch continues forwarding traffic.
Once SVL is restored, the recovered switch rejoins automatically.
‚û§ DAD Methods Supported
Detection Type	Description	Recommended
Enhanced PAgP (ePAgP)	Uses EtherChannel neighbor communication (if connected to Cisco switch using ePAgP)	‚úÖ
Fast Hello	Uses direct Layer 2 hello packets between switches	‚úÖ (most common)
BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)	Optional (rarely used in SVL)	‚öôÔ∏è Optional
‚û§ DAD Configuration Example (Fast Hello)
interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/48
  stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
!
interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/48
  stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
This forms a dedicated L2 link between both switches purely for DAD keepalive packets.
‚û§ DAD Operation Example
Event	Action
SVL up	Both switches synced ‚Äî one active, one standby
SVL down but DAD up	DAD verifies which switch is truly active
Both Active detected	Standby enters Recovery mode, shuts down non-SVL ports
SVL restored	Recovery switch reboots and rejoins as standby
‚û§ DAD Status Verification
show stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
Sample Output:
Dual-Active-Detection: Enabled
Method: Fast Hello
Local Interface: TenGigabitEthernet1/0/48
Peer Interface: TenGigabitEthernet2/0/48
Status: Up
If it shows Status: Down, DAD is not functioning ‚Äî that‚Äôs dangerous.
‚û§ DAD Recovery Behavior
When a dual-active condition is detected:
One switch (usually standby) enters Recovery Mode
All non-SVL ports are shut down
Only management ports and console remain accessible
Syslog shows:
%STACKW-VIRTUAL-1-DUAL_ACTIVE_RECOVERY: Dual-active condition detected, entering recovery mode
To recover:
Fix SVL/DAD connectivity
Then reload the affected switch:
reload
üîπ 3. Summary of SVL vs DAD Roles
Feature	StackWise Virtual Link (SVL)	Dual Active Detection (DAD)
Purpose	Main control/data link between switches	Backup link to detect split-brain
Type	Port-channel (Layer 2)	Layer 2 link or protocol
Traffic	Control plane, data plane sync	Keepalive / heartbeat only
Typical Bandwidth	40G/100G	1G or 10G
Failure Impact	Causes loss of sync	Detects and recovers from dual-active
Common Config	stackwise-virtual link 1	stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
üîß Best Practices
‚úÖ Use 2 SVL links (on different modules/slots)
‚úÖ Use 1 DAD link (direct cable between both switches)
‚úÖ Keep DAD separate from production traffic
‚úÖ Verify both SVL and DAD show ‚ÄúUp‚Äù before enabling production traffic
‚úÖ Always check after reboot:
show stackwise-virtual
show stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
show redundancy
Would you like me to show a diagram (textual or visual) of how the SVL + DAD connection layout should look on a Catalyst 9500 pair? It helps visualize the architecture clearly.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect üëç ‚Äî the Cisco Catalyst 9300 supports both traditional StackWise-480/1T (physical stacking) and StackWise Virtual (logical stacking, like in 9500).
Since you‚Äôre asking about ‚Äúdual-active-detection and link‚Äù, you‚Äôre referring to StackWise Virtual (SVL) ‚Äî which behaves almost the same as on the 9500, but with some hardware and config differences.

Let‚Äôs go through this in detail, step by step üëá

‚öôÔ∏è Cisco Catalyst 9300 StackWise Virtual ‚Äî SVL & DAD Explained
üîπ 1. StackWise Virtual Overview (9300)
Combines two physical 9300 switches into one logical switch
You get a single management IP, single configuration, and unified control plane
Improves redundancy and bandwidth (active/standby control plane with nonstop forwarding)
Key Links
Link Type	Purpose	Required
StackWise Virtual Link (SVL)	Main inter-switch control and data link	‚úÖ Yes
Dual-Active Detection (DAD)	Backup link to prevent split-brain	‚úÖ Yes
üß© 2. StackWise Virtual Link (SVL)
‚û§ What it does
The SVL connects the two switches' backplanes virtually ‚Äî synchronizing:
Control-plane info
Forwarding tables
VLAN, STP, MAC, routing data
It also carries data traffic between the chassis (for VLANs or EtherChannels spanning both).
‚û§ Requirements
Requirement	Recommended
Link type	Port-channel (L2)
Interfaces	10G, 25G, or 40G capable
Minimum	1 SVL (recommended 2)
Speed	40G or 100G preferred
Purpose	Main inter-switch link
‚û§ Example Configuration

interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/47
  stackwise-virtual link 1

interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/47
  stackwise-virtual link 1
!
interface Port-channel10
  description StackWise Virtual Link
  switchport mode trunk
üí° You can bundle multiple interfaces into a Port-Channel for redundancy.
‚öôÔ∏è 3. Dual-Active Detection (DAD)
‚û§ Why it's needed
If the SVL fails (link down or cable issue), both switches lose contact.
Each thinks: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm active!‚Äù ‚Üí Dual-active (split-brain) condition.
This causes:

Duplicate IP/MAC addresses
Network loops
Control plane instability
To prevent this, DAD provides an independent heartbeat between the two switches.
‚û§ DAD Options on 9300
DAD Method	Description	Common Use
Fast Hello	Direct L2 keepalives between the switches	‚úÖ Most common
Enhanced PAgP (ePAgP)	Uses neighbor negotiation (if connected via EtherChannel)	Optional
BFD	Rare, high-speed detection method	Rare
‚û§ DAD Configuration Example (Fast Hello)
interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/48
  stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
!
interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/48
  stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
üí° This creates a direct physical link between the two switches (not part of SVL or network traffic).
You can use a 1G or 10G link.
üîç 4. How SVL + DAD Work Together
Event	SVL Status	DAD Status	Result
Normal	Up	Up	One Active, One Standby
SVL fails	Down	Up	DAD detects peer still alive ‚Üí One stays Active, other goes Recovery
SVL fails	Down	Down	Both become Active (Dual-Active condition) ‚ùå
SVL restored	Up	Up	Standby rejoins automatically
üîß 5. Verification Commands
‚û§ Check SVL status
show stackwise-virtual
Example output:
Stackwise Virtual Configuration:
Domain Number: 1
Switch 1 Role: Active
Switch 2 Role: Standby
Stackwise Virtual Link 1: Up
Dual-Active Detection: Enabled
‚û§ Check DAD status
show stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
Example:
Dual-Active Detection Mode: Fast Hello
Status: Up
Local Interface: TenGigabitEthernet1/0/48
Peer Interface: TenGigabitEthernet2/0/48
‚û§ Check redundancy
show redundancy
Redundant System Information :
------------------------------
Active Location: Switch 1
Standby Location: Switch 2
Redundancy Mode: SSO
Operating Mode: Stateful Switchover
‚û§ Check interface mapping
show interfaces status | include Stackwise
show switch
‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Dual-Active Recovery Scenario
When DAD detects both switches active:
One switch (usually standby) enters recovery mode
It shuts down all non-SVL ports
Logs message:
%STACKW-VIRTUAL-1-DUAL_ACTIVE_RECOVERY: Dual-active detected. Entering recovery mode.
Recovery switch waits for SVL restoration and reboot.
You can verify it:
show logging | include dual
show platform software redundancy
To restore:
Fix the SVL or DAD cabling issue
Reboot the recovery switch
reload
üí° 7. Best Practices
‚úÖ Use at least 2 x SVL links (40G/100G each)
‚úÖ Use dedicated 1G/10G ports for DAD (Fast Hello)
‚úÖ Do not use production VLANs for DAD
‚úÖ Place DAD ports on separate modules if possible
‚úÖ Verify both SVL and DAD are ‚ÄúUp‚Äù before bringing up user links
‚úÖ Save configuration after enabling:

üß† 9. Summary ‚Äî SVL vs DAD (9300)
Feature	StackWise Virtual Link (SVL)	Dual Active Detection (DAD)
Purpose	Connects control/data plane between two 9300s	Prevents split-brain

Good observation üëè ‚Äî that tells us something important about your Catalyst 9300 setup.
Let‚Äôs break down why you don‚Äôt see stackwise-virtual commands and what that means depending on your hardware and software version.

üîπ 1. You‚Äôre Currently Using Traditional StackWise ‚Äî Not StackWise Virtual
If your switch only shows:
Switch# show switch
and not:
Switch(config)# stackwise-virtual
then your 9300 is using physical stacking (StackWise-480 or StackWise-1T) ‚Äî not StackWise Virtual.
üî∏ StackWise-480 / StackWise-1T (Traditional Stacking)
‚û§ How it works
Uses StackWise cables (special backplane cables) in the stack ports on the rear panel.
You can stack up to 8 switches.
All switches act as one logical unit, with one Active (master) and the rest Members.
‚û§ Key Commands
show switch
show switch detail
show switch stack-ports
show switch stack-ring speed
‚û§ Example Output
Switch/Stack Mac Address : 00c5.ab11.2233
H/W   Current
Switch#  Role   Mac Address     Priority Version  State
----------------------------------------------------------
*1       Active 00c5.ab11.2233     15     V02     Ready
 2       Member 00c5.ab22.3344     10     V02     Ready
‚û§ Stack Ring Status
show switch stack-ring speed
show switch stack-ring detail
You‚Äôll see:
Stack Ring Speed: 480G
Stack Ring Configuration: Full
‚úÖ ‚ÄúFull‚Äù = both StackWise cables are connected properly
‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ÄúHalf‚Äù = one cable disconnected
üîπ 2. StackWise Virtual ‚Äî Only on Certain Models and Modes
If you don‚Äôt see the stackwise-virtual command, check the following:
‚úÖ Supported Models
Catalyst 9300X ‚úÖ (supports StackWise Virtual)
Catalyst 9300 (non-X) ‚ùå (does NOT support StackWise Virtual)
The older 9300 non-X models only support physical StackWise-480, not SVL.
üîπ 3. Check Your Hardware Model
Run:
show version | include Model
If you see something like:
Model number: C9300-24T
Model number: C9300-48P
‚Üí This is non-X, supports physical StackWise only.
If you see:

Model number: C9300X-24Y
Model number: C9300X-48HX
‚Üí This is 9300X, supports StackWise Virtual (SVL + DAD).
üîπ 4. Check IOS-XE Version
Even if you have 9300X, you need IOS-XE 17.3.x or later for stackwise-virtual support.
Run:

show version | include Version
You should see something like:
Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 17.6.3
If it‚Äôs older (like 16.x or early 17.1), SVL may not appear.
üîπ 5. Summary Table
Feature	Traditional Stack (StackWise-480/1T)	StackWise Virtual
Supported Models	9300 (non-X)	9300X only
Cables Used	StackWise rear cables	Ethernet links (40G/100G)
Max Members	8	2
CLI Command	show switch, show switch stack-ports	show stackwise-virtual, show stackwise-virtual link
Dual-Active Detection	‚ùå Not used	‚úÖ Required
Control Plane	Single (on master)	Dual (Active/Standby)
üîπ 6. What You Can Do
If your output looks like this:
Switch# show switch
Switch/Stack Mac Address : 0001.4333.aaaa
H/W Current
Switch#  Role   Mac Address     Priority Version  State
----------------------------------------------------------
*1       Active 0001.4333.aaaa     15     V02     Ready
 2       Member 0001.4333.bbbb     10     V02     Ready
Then you are using traditional StackWise-480/1T.
You can manage the stack using:
show switch detail
show switch stack-ports
show switch stack-ring speed
show redundancy
show platform stack-manager all
You won‚Äôt have:
stackwise-virtual
show stackwise-virtual
because your hardware doesn‚Äôt support SVL.
Would you like me to show you:
üß† the advanced commands and best practices for traditional StackWise (your setup),
or

Redundancy state	show redundancy	show redundancy + DAD status
Configure stack	switch 2 priority 15	stackwise-virtual, stackwise-virtual link 1, stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
üîπ 5. Key Takeaways
Traditional StackWise (480/1T):
Hardware-based
Up to 8 switches
Only one active master
No dual-active detection
Failover slower (master election)
StackWise Virtual:
Logical stack
Only 2 switches
Active/Standby control plane
Dual-active detection mandatory
Failover is instant
üí° Quick Rule:
If you see show switch only ‚Üí traditional StackWise (physical).
If you see stackwise-virtual commands ‚Üí StackWise Virtual (SVL + DAD).
If you want, I can make a visual diagram comparing both stack types ‚Äî showing links, active/standby, DAD, and failover paths. It‚Äôs super easy to remember.
Do you want me to make that diagram?

ChatGPT said:
Ah! Let me explain clearly what ‚ÄúOnly master active‚Äù vs ‚ÄúBoth switches active/standby (HA)‚Äù really means in the context of Cisco switches.
üîπ 1. Only Master Active (Traditional StackWise, e.g., 9300 non-X)
In a traditional StackWise stack:
One switch is elected as the master.
All control-plane operations (routing protocols, management, STP, VLAN database, MAC address table updates) are handled by the master.
The other stack members are standby ‚Äî they forward traffic at line rate but do not control the stack.
If the master fails:
A new master is elected among the remaining members.
This takes some time (master election delay) before the stack is fully functional.
Analogy: Think of it like a classroom with one teacher (master) and several students (members). Only the teacher makes decisions. If the teacher leaves, a new teacher is chosen.
üîπ Key Points
Control plane: Only master runs it.
Data plane: All members forward traffic.
Failover: Master election takes time ‚Üí short disruption possible.
Redundancy: Limited ‚Äî only master handles state; other members are passive in control.
üîπ 2. Both Switches Active/Standby (StackWise Virtual, e.g., 9300X / 9500)
In StackWise Virtual (SVL):
Two switches form a single logical switch.
Active switch: Primary control-plane operations.
Standby switch: Receives a synchronized copy of control-plane data in real-time.
Both switches are ready to take over instantly if the active switch fails.
Analogy: Think of it like two co-teachers (active + standby) in sync:
Active leads the class.
Standby has a live copy of everything the active is doing.
If active leaves suddenly, standby immediately continues without loss of information.
üîπ Key Points
Control plane: Active runs it, standby synced in real-time.
Data plane: Distributed across both switches (both forward traffic).
Failover: Instant (sub-second) ‚Üí no disruption.
Redundancy: High ‚Äî standby has full copy of all state/config.
DAD: Ensures only one active exists (prevents split-brain).

Ah! Now we‚Äôre moving into Cisco Nexus / datacenter concepts. Let‚Äôs break down vPC (Virtual Port-Channel) clearly.
üîπ What is vPC (Virtual Port-Channel)?
vPC = Virtual Port-Channel
It‚Äôs a Cisco technology (used on Nexus switches, and also on some Catalyst 9000 series like 9500/9300X in datacenter setups) that allows:

Two physical switches to appear as a single logical switch to downstream devices.
EtherChannel links from a server, router, or switch to connect to both switches simultaneously.
Loop-free Layer 2 topology without using STP blocking ports.
üîπ Key Benefits of vPC
Benefit	Explanation
Active-Active links	Both switches can forward traffic simultaneously, unlike standard STP blocking ports.
High Availability	If one vPC peer fails, traffic continues through the other peer.
No STP Blocking	Downstream sees vPC as one switch, so STP doesn‚Äôt block any links.
Redundancy	Servers/links don‚Äôt need to wait for STP convergence on failure.
üîπ How vPC Works
Components
vPC Peer Switches ‚Üí Two switches in vPC domain.
vPC Peer-Link ‚Üí A dedicated link between the two switches that synchronizes MAC, STP, ARP, and other L2 info.
vPC Member Ports ‚Üí Physical interfaces connected to downstream device (server, access switch), forming a port-channel across both switches.
vPC Keepalive Link ‚Üí A separate Layer 3 link to detect if the peer is alive (prevents split-brain).
üîπ Visual Concept (Textual)
Downstream Device
      ‚îÇ
      ‚îÇ  Port-Channel (vPC)
+-----------+      +-----------+
| Switch 1  |======| Switch 2  |  <-- vPC Peer-Link
| (vPC Peer)|      | (vPC Peer)|
+-----------+      +-----------+
The downstream device sees one logical switch.
Each switch can forward traffic independently.
Peer-Link keeps the MAC and STP info synchronized.
üîπ Commands to Check vPC
show vpc                # Shows vPC summary and status
show vpc brief          # Quick view of vPC domain, peer status, port-channels
show vpc consistency-parameters  # Checks if configs match
show port-channel summary         # Verify member ports
show running-config | section vpc # Shows vPC config
Sample Output (simplified):
vPC domain id : 10
Peer status   : Peer adjacency formed ok
vPC keep-alive: Up
vPC Peer-link : Up
vPC1          : Up   (ports Po10)
vPC2          : Down (ports Po20)
üîπ Key Notes
Peer-Link is mandatory ‚Äî carries traffic if one switch loses connection to downstream.
Keepalive link is mandatory ‚Äî Layer 3 link to prevent split-brain.
vPC Member Ports are active-active; do not run STP blocking.
Used mostly in datacenter top-of-rack (ToR) switches for redundancy and bandwidth.
‚úÖ Summary:
vPC = Active-active EtherChannel across two physical switches appearing as one logical switch to a downstream device, giving high availability, redundancy, and no STP blocking.
If you want, I can draw a simple diagram comparing traditional EtherChannel vs vPC so you can visually see the difference between STP blocking ports vs active-active vPC.
Do you want me to do that?

diff betw vpc and stackwise
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! Let‚Äôs compare vPC and StackWise side by side so it‚Äôs crystal clear. They both deal with switch redundancy and link aggregation, but work very differently.
üîπ 1. Basic Definition
Feature	StackWise	vPC (Virtual Port-Channel)
Definition	Combines multiple physical switches into one logical switch (control + data plane unified)	Combines two physical switches to allow active-active links to a downstream device
Scope	Entire stack of switches acts as one unit	Downstream device sees two separate switches as one logical switch for link aggregation
Redundancy	Master/standby or active/member	Peer active-active forwarding with redundancy for downstream links
üîπ 2. Control Plane & Data Plane
Feature	StackWise	vPC
Control Plane	Single control plane (master), or Active/Standby in SVL	Each switch has its own control plane (independent)
Data Plane	Distributed (StackWise) or master-only forwarding	Active-active forwarding to downstream devices via vPC member ports
Failover	StackWise: master failure ‚Üí new master elected	vPC: downstream traffic continues via surviving switch
üîπ 3. Redundancy & Failover
Feature	StackWise	vPC
Redundancy Type	Entire stack acts as one, internal failover between members	Only redundancy for downstream links; switches themselves remain independent
Split-brain Protection	Not needed (traditional), DAD used in SVL	Peer Keepalive + Peer Link used to prevent split-brain
Member Awareness	Stack members share config/state	Downstream device sees single logical switch, but switches maintain independent configs
üîπ 4. Connectivity
Feature	StackWise	vPC
Internal Links	StackWise cables (physical)	Peer-Link (Ethernet) + Keepalive (L3)
Downstream Links	Downstream devices connect to any member	Downstream device uses port-channel across two vPC peers
Maximum Members	8 (9300), varies by model	2 switches (peer pair)
üîπ 5. Use Case
Feature	StackWise	vPC
Best For	Campus access / aggregation switches	Data center ToR / servers / core switches
Traffic Forwarding	Internal stack traffic distributed automatically	Downstream traffic load-balanced across vPC member links
Management	Single IP, single config for stack	Each switch has own management IP; downstream sees single logical switch
üîπ 6. Key Points
StackWise = ‚Äúmerge multiple switches into one big switch‚Äù
Full control plane unification
Master/standby or active/member
Physical stacking cables or SVL
vPC = ‚Äútwo switches appear as one to downstream device‚Äù
Each switch keeps its own control plane
Active-active forwarding to servers
Peer-Link + Keepalive prevent split-brain
üîπ Quick Analogy
StackWise: ‚ÄúOne switch made of many physical switches‚Äù ‚Üí everything unified inside.
vPC: ‚ÄúTwo switches pretending to be one to your server‚Äù ‚Üí downstream sees one, but switches are independent inside.
If you want, I can draw a simple diagram comparing StackWise vs vPC, showing:
Which links are used
Active/standby roles
Downstream connection differences
This really makes the difference obvious visually.
Do you want me to draw that?

Peer-Link (Ethernet) + Keepalive (L3), what is l3 means
ChatGPT said:
Ah! Let‚Äôs clarify this carefully.
üîπ Peer-Link + Keepalive in vPC
In vPC, there are two key links between the peer switches:
Peer-Link (Ethernet)
Layer 2 connection
Carries data plane traffic that has to traverse both switches
Synchronizes MAC, STP, ARP, and other L2 information
vPC Keepalive (L3)
Layer 3 connection (IP-based)
Does not carry user/data traffic
Only sends small heartbeat messages between the two vPC peers
Detects if the other switch is alive
Prevents split-brain scenario
üîπ What ‚ÄúL3‚Äù Means Here
L3 = Layer 3 (Network Layer) in the OSI model
Uses IP addresses to ping each other over the network
Can be on any routable network (even a management VLAN or separate subnet)
Example configuration:
interface Vlan10
  ip address 10.1.1.1/24   ! On Switch 1
!
interface Vlan10
  ip address 10.1.1.2/24   ! On Switch 2
!
vpc domain 1
  peer-keepalive destination 10.1.1.2 source 10.1.1.1
Switch 1 sends periodic IP-based heartbeat packets to Switch 2.
If keepalive fails, switches know the peer is unreachable.
üîπ Why L3 Keepalive is Important
The Peer-Link can fail but switches may still be operational.
L3 keepalive ensures:
If Peer-Link is down, switches detect each other over Layer 3.
Only one switch will remain active (prevents dual-active).
üîπ Difference Between Peer-Link and Keepalive
Feature	Peer-Link	Keepalive (L3)
Layer	2	3
Carries	Data, control, sync	Heartbeat only
Purpose	Sync MAC, STP, FDB	Detect if peer alive, prevent split-brain
Required	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
üí° Quick analogy:
Peer-Link = ‚Äúbridge for traffic between two switches‚Äù
Keepalive = ‚Äúphone call checking if the other switch is awake‚Äù
If you want, I can draw a simple diagram showing vPC Peer-Link + L3 Keepalive with traffic and heartbeat flow, which makes it very easy to visualize.
Do you want me to make that diagram?
