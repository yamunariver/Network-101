Ah! You want a **single place where all the explanations we’ve discussed can be copied at once**, so you don’t have to copy each answer separately. I can consolidate everything from **StackWise, StackWise Virtual, vPC, DAD, SVL, 9300 vs 9500** into **one neatly organized text** for you.

Here’s the combined version:

---

# **Cisco StackWise, StackWise Virtual, and vPC Concepts**

---

## **1. StackWise (Traditional, e.g., 9300 non-X)**

**Definition:** Combines multiple physical switches into one logical switch.

* **Master active only:** One switch (master) runs control plane; members forward traffic only.
* **Failover:** Master fails → new master elected (some delay).
* **Redundancy:** Limited.
* **Cables:** StackWise cables (rear port).
* **Max Members:** 8.
* **Commands:**

  ```bash
  show switch
  show switch detail
  show switch stack-ports
  show redundancy
  ```
* **Use Case:** Campus access/aggregation switches.

**Visual Concept (Textual):**

```
+-------------------+
| Master (Active)   |  <-- Control plane runs here
+-------------------+
| Member 1          |
| Member 2          |
+-------------------+
```

---

## **2. StackWise Virtual (SVL, e.g., 9300X / 9500)**

**Definition:** Logical stack of 2 switches acting as a single switch.

* **Active/Standby:** One switch active, one standby (HA). Standby synced in real-time.
* **Failover:** Instant (sub-second).
* **Dual-Active Detection (DAD):** Prevents split-brain.
* **Links:**

  * **SVL (StackWise Virtual Link):** Carries control/data plane between switches.
  * **DAD Link:** Backup heartbeat for split-brain detection.
* **Max Members:** 2.
* **Commands:**

  ```bash
  stackwise-virtual
  show stackwise-virtual
  show stackwise-virtual link
  show stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
  show redundancy
  ```
* **Use Case:** High availability campus/core networks.

**Visual Concept (Textual):**

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
| Active Switch     | <--> | Standby Switch    |  <-- Synced control-plane
| Control Plane ON  |      | Control Plane Copy|
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
| Data Plane BOTH   |      | Data Plane BOTH   |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
```

## **3. Dual-Active Detection (DAD)**

**Purpose:** Prevents **split-brain** when SVL fails.

* **Methods:** Fast Hello (L2), Enhanced PAgP (ePAgP), BFD.
* **Behavior:**

  * SVL down → DAD checks peer → only one switch remains active.
  * Both active detected → Recovery mode for standby switch.
* **Commands:**

  ```bash
  show stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
  ```

---

## **4. vPC (Virtual Port-Channel)**

**Definition:** Two switches appear as a single logical switch to downstream devices; allows **active-active EtherChannel**.

* **Components:**

  * **vPC Peer-Link:** L2 link for MAC/STP sync and traffic forwarding.
  * **vPC Keepalive (L3):** IP-based heartbeat to detect peer alive.
  * **vPC Member Ports:** Downstream devices connect as a port-channel.
* **Benefits:**

  * Active-active links without STP blocking
  * Redundant and highly available
  * Downstream device sees one logical switch
* **Commands:**

  ```bash
  show vpc
  show vpc brief
  show vpc consistency-parameters
  show port-channel summary
  ```

**L3 Keepalive Explained:**

* Layer 3 = IP-based heartbeat
* Does **not carry data traffic**
* Detects split-brain if peer-link fails
* Example:

```bash
interface Vlan10
  ip address 10.1.1.1/24   ! Switch 1
interface Vlan10
  ip address 10.1.1.2/24   ! Switch 2
vpc domain 1
  peer-keepalive destination 10.1.1.2 source 10.1.1.1
```

**Visual Concept (Textual):**

```
Downstream Device
      │
      │  Port-Channel (vPC)
+-----------+      +-----------+
| Switch 1  |======| Switch 2  |  <-- vPC Peer-Link
| (vPC Peer)|      | (vPC Peer)|
+-----------+      +-----------+
```

## **5. StackWise vs vPC**

| Feature       | StackWise                                               | vPC                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition    | Merge multiple switches into one                        | Two switches appear as one to downstream               |
| Control Plane | Only master active (traditional) / Active-Standby (SVL) | Each switch independent                                |
| Data Plane    | Distributed (StackWise)                                 | Active-active forwarding to downstream                 |
| Redundancy    | Master election / standby                               | Peer-Link + L3 Keepalive                               |
| Failover      | Stackwise: master fails → new master                    | vPC: downstream traffic continues via surviving switch |
| Scope         | Entire stack                                            | Downstream device only                                 |
| Max Members   | 8                                                       | 2                                                      |

**Analogy:**

* StackWise = One switch made of many switches
* vPC = Two switches pretending to be one for servers

If you want, I can also **create a single “copy button style” HTML snippet** so you can literally **copy all this text in one click** in a browser or editor.

Do you want me to generate that?
